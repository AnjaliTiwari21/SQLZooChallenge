SELECT within SELECT Tutorial

1. List each country name where the population is larger than that of 'Russia'.
SELECT name FROM world
  WHERE population >
     (SELECT population FROM world
      WHERE name='Russia')
      
2. Show the countries in Europe with a per capita GDP greater than 'United Kingdom'.
SELECT name
FROM world
WHERE gdp/population>(SELECT gdp/population 
                      FROM world 
                      WHERE name='United Kingdom') 
                      AND continent='Europe'
                      
3.  List the name and continent of countries in the continents containing either Argentina or Australia. Order by name of the country.
SELECT name, continent
FROM world
WHERE continent IN (SELECT continent
       FROM world
       WHERE name IN ('Argentina','Australia'))
ORDER BY name

4. Which country has a population that is more than United Kingom but less than Germany? Show the name and the population.
SELECT name,population
FROM world
WHERE population > ( SELECT population FROM world WHERE name='Canada') and 
population<( SELECT population FROM world WHERE name='Poland')

5. Show the name and the population of each country in Europe. Show the population as a percentage of the population of Germany.
SELECT name, CONCAT(CAST(ROUND(population/(SELECT population from world where name='Germany')*100,0) AS int), '%') as percentage
FROM world 
where continent='Europe'

6. Which countries have a GDP greater than every country in Europe? [Give the name only.] (Some countries may have NULL gdp values)
SELECT name
FROM world
WHERE gdp > (SELECT max(gdp) FROM world where continent='Europe')

7. Find the largest country (by area) in each continent, show the continent, the name and the area:
SELECT continent, name, area 
FROM world x
WHERE area >= ALL
    (SELECT area 
     FROM world y
     WHERE y.continent=x.continent
     AND area>0)
     
8. List each continent and the name of the country that comes first alphabetically.
SELECT continent, name 
FROM world x 
WHERE name = (SELECT min(name) 
              FROM world y 
              WHERE x.continent = y.continent );

9. Find the continents where all countries have a population <= 25000000. Then find the names of the countries associated with these continents. Show name, continent and population.
SELECT x.name, x.continent, x.population
FROM world AS x
WHERE 25000000 > ALL (
  SELECT y.population
  FROM world AS y
  WHERE x.continent = y.continent);
  
10. Some countries have populations more than three times that of all of their neighbours (in the same continent). Give the countries and continents.
SELECT x.name, x.continent
FROM world AS x
WHERE x.population/3 > ALL (
  SELECT y.population
  FROM world AS y
  WHERE x.continent = y.continent
  AND x.name != y.name);

          
8. List each continent and the name of the country that comes first alphabetically.
